Title:
Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM Neural Networks

Problem Statement:
The goal is to predict future stock prices based on historical stock data using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. This involves training a model on past stock prices and evaluating its performance in predicting future prices, aiming to provide insights or support decision-making for investments.

Explanation of the LSTM Code:
Libraries and Data:
Pandas and Pandas DataReader: Used for data manipulation and to fetch historical stock prices.
Numpy: For numerical operations on arrays.
Matplotlib: For plotting graphs.
Sklearn: Specifically, the MinMaxScaler from the sklearn.preprocessing module is used for scaling the data.
TensorFlow and Keras: For building and training the LSTM model.
Data Preparation:
Data Acquisition: The code begins by fetching historical stock price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) using the get_data_tiingo method from pandas_datareader, with an API key required for Tiingo.
Preprocessing: The stock prices are then scaled to a range between 0 and 1 using MinMaxScaler. This normalization is crucial for neural network performance.
Training and Test Split: The dataset is split into training and test sets, with 65% of the data used for training and the rest for testing. This separation is important for evaluating the model on unseen data.
Creating Time Series Data:
A function create_dataset is defined to convert the series of prices into a supervised learning problem. For each entry, it creates a set of previous stock prices (as input features) and the next stock price (as the target output).

Building the LSTM Model:
The model consists of:

Input Layer: Accepts sequences of 100 time steps, each with one feature (the stock price).
LSTM Layers: Three LSTM layers are added with 50 units each to capture the time-dependent patterns in the data. The first two LSTM layers return sequences because their output is fed into another LSTM layer. The last LSTM layer returns a single output corresponding to the predicted stock price.
Dense Layer: A dense layer with a single unit to output the predicted price.
Compilation: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function, suitable for regression problems.
Training:
The model is trained using the training data for 100 epochs with a batch size of 64. Validation data (test set) is used to monitor the model's performance on unseen data.

Prediction and Evaluation:
Prediction: The model predicts stock prices for the training and test sets.
Inverse Transformation: Predictions and actual values are inverse-transformed to return them to their original scale.
Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric, comparing the predicted prices against the actual prices.
Plotting:
Graphical visualizations are provided to compare the actual stock prices with the predicted prices from the model, offering a visual assessment of the model's prediction accuracy.

Future Predictions:
The model is finally used to predict stock prices for future days, showcasing its potential utility in forecasting.

This LSTM-based model aims to leverage the time-series nature of stock price data, utilizing LSTM's ability to remember long-term dependencies, thereby making more accurate predictions than traditional time-series forecasting methods.
